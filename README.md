# First-android-app-Blanchett

My "Hello World" project for Android apps, one of the first assignments for an App Development class. Also a playground for testing.

The screenshots included show the progression of different stages, such as opening a sample project, making a basic project, causing the basic project to crash, and watching for errors. 

Written in/for Android Studio.
